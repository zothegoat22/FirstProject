I enjoy this class for 3 main reasons:
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night.
Dwong's poem
Today was the day
That I couldnt play
